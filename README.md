This project is from my Data Mining undergraduate course and i try to analyze data of Covid-19 pandemic. 
The analysis is related to total cases per million, total deaths per million and mortality rate indexes for countries worldwide compared with country indexes as gdp per capita, hospital beds per thousand of people and population density to visualize the spreading of the virus and to observe the pandemic management from the 5 continents.
Moreover due to the recent USA elections of 2020 i try to figure out if the cases and deaths of each USA country seem to affect the vote preference.
